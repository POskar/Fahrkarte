Mobile application which works as a company-wide ticket management system written as my Bachelors thesis project,

Application was written in Kotlin. It uses two activities - Intro and Main with multiple fragments serving their own purpose. Users, tickets and tasks are stored within Firestore where registering and logging process are handled by FirebaseAuthentication.
Whole project was created with the use of MVC pattern.
